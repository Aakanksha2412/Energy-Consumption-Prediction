# 🔋 Energy Consumption Prediction

This repository contains an analytical presentation focused on energy conservation strategies, specifically addressing the challenges posed by increasing temperatures, global warming, and peak energy demands affecting energy grids.

## 📚 Project Overview

### **Objective:**
- Identify primary factors driving residential energy consumption.
- Propose actionable energy-saving measures to mitigate the need for additional infrastructure.

### **Data Sources:**
- **Static House Data:** Information on approximately 5,000 single-family homes using eSC energy.
- **Energy Usage Data:** Hourly consumption data per residence.
- **Weather Data:** Hourly weather statistics across different geographic regions (counties).
- **Meta Data:** Descriptive file outlining dataset variables.

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

The analysis covered several key areas:

1. **Peak Energy Consumption Patterns:**
   - Regional analysis by hour to determine peak usage times.

2. **HVAC and Setpoint Analysis:**
   - Relationship between HVAC cooling types and energy consumption.
   - Influence of thermostat setpoints on overall energy usage.

3. **Building Characteristics Impact:**
   - Analysis of energy consumption by building age and size.
   - Assessment of lighting types and their proportion across building vintages.

4. **Duct Insulation Efficiency:**
   - Comparative analysis of energy savings through improved duct insulation.

## ⚡ Key Recommendations

- **Strategic Energy Management:**
  - Emphasis on performance-based strategies rather than just building age.
  - Conduct detailed energy audits to identify and address specific inefficiencies.

- **Smart Thermostat Integration:**
  - Encourage the adoption of smart thermostats for optimized energy use.
  - Adjust energy consumption dynamically based on real-time occupancy and off-peak opportunities.

- **Targeted Building System Retrofits:**
  - Prioritize upgrades to high-efficiency HVAC systems and improve duct insulation.
  - Utilize data-driven insights to pinpoint specific retrofit targets.

- **Data-Driven Infrastructure Development:**
  - Develop community solar projects informed by regional energy demand data.
  - Enhance grid stability by supporting demand-side energy generation initiatives.
